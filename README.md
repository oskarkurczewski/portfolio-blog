# portfolio-blog

Personal website - portfolio with a blog for a photographer (well, me actually 👀). It's the final project of my first degree studies at Politechnika Lodzka. Design was made in Figma, preceded by an extensive research about similar solutions. I used Next.js and Strapi to implement the website 👨‍💻
